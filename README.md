This program uses the finger library to interface with a fingerprint scanner. It initializes the scanner and the voting system, and then enters an infinite loop where it scans a fingerprint, identifies it, and updates the voting system. The voting results are printed to the console.

To use this program, you will need to install the finger library using pip install finger. You will also need to connect a fingerprint scanner to your computer and replace the '03FGC2213' argument in the finger.Scanner() function with the serial number of your scanner.
